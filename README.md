# Temporal Scala Example

This repository contains a very simple example demonstrating how to use the Temporal Java SDK in a Scala project.

## Requirements

*(AKA What I had installed)*

* Scala 3+
* SBT 1.9.8
* Java 1.8+
* Local Temporal Server. This is straightforward with the [Temporal CLI](https://github.com/temporalio/cli)

## Build and run

```
sbt compile
sbt run
```
